#Project Overview

In this project, I'll be building an online bookstore application using React. I'll be fetching data from the Google Books API and displaying it in a visually appealing manner as per the provided Figma design and will also be implementing a search feature to find and display books based on user queries.

#User Interface
Figma - https://www.figma.com/file/HmJl1YcejIXNc6Hr1ZQpjm/BookStore-UI?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=DUj3MYs02a04qpfj-1

#Objective
The goal of this project is to create a responsive online bookstore application. This application fetches data from Google Books API, displays it in an elegant UI as per the provided Figma design, provides a search feature, and gives detailed information about each book.

Project Brief
Use the Google Books API to fetch and display data about books.
Display a list of books obtained from the API requests in a visually appealing manner using the Figma design provided.
Implement a search feature to find and display books based on user queries.
Show a detailed information panel for each book when clicked, following the design in Figma.

APIs Used
We'll be hitting two APIs as soon as the user lands on the page:

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=harry+potter
https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=Sherlock+Holmes
Change the q according to your query.
Project Setup
Set up a new React application using create-react-app.
Review the Figma design and plan your component hierarchy.

Fetching and Displaying Initial Book Data
Use useEffect to fetch data from atleast two API calls (search for harry+potter and sherlock+holmes) when the app loads.
Use useState to store this book data.
Map through this data to display the books on the home screen as per the Figma design.

Book Detail View
When a book is clicked, expand its banner to full width and show detailed information about the book.
The "Read Now" button should redirect the user to the previewLink from the book data.
The "More Info" button should redirect the user to the infoLink from the book data.

Search Feature
Implement a search bar in the top navbar.
When the search button is clicked, fetch data from the Google Books API with the user's query and display the results. Make sure that whatever the user types becomes the q in the API endpoint.
